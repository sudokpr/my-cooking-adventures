**ಅಭಿರುಚಿ (_Abhiruchi_ )** - Personal taste, interests or preferences

I like to search, explore and experiment with new recipes all the time. To encourage my passion for cooking and share my learnings with everyone, my husband, a full-time techie, built this website as a gift.

This virtual cookbook is a collection of my experiments in cooking. Being a vegetarian by choice, you will find only vegetarian recipes across multiple cuisines. I will try my best to keep the recipes very simple and quick to prepare, with step-by-step pictures and directions. I hope I can inspire and convince, at least a few of you, with some love and a good appetite anyone can prepare amazing dishes.
