**ಅಭಿರುಚಿ (_Abhiruchi_ )** - Personal taste, interests or preferences

I like to search, explore and experiment with new recipes all the time. To share my recipes with the world, my husband, a full-time techie 👨‍💻, built this website as a gift for me. We call it a "virtual cookbook"!

This cookbook is a collection of my experiments in cooking. Being a vegetarian by choice, you will find only vegetarian recipes across multiple cuisines. I will keep the recipes simple and quick to prepare, with step-by-step pictures and directions. I hope to inspire and convince some of you that with some love and an appetite to learn, anyone can prepare simple, and amazing dishes.
